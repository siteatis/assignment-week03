I still have lots of reading and notes to catch up on on CSS (Week 1) and accessibility (Week 2) and I can only do "half a job" on those right now. So since they aren't part of the focus for this week's work, I decided to skip them so there's minimal styling on this assignment and it isn't accessible. I'll make up for it in future weeks!

Their example used the visiblitychange event, but we don't have anything to actually change, we just need to stop the cookies baking, so all I had to do was check the document.hidden property whenever the timer callback runs.
