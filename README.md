ASSIGNMENT ABANDONED - DOES NOT WORK - OUT OF TIME
IT TOOK ME UNTUIL ABOUT 4PM SUNDAY TO GET CAUGHT UP ON THE WORK FROM THE WEEK AND SRAT LOOKING AT TBHIS ASSIGNMENT SO I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO IT
It was looking OK but I havbe one impossible bug I can;t make any progress on and it';s a compelt showstopper as the shop woin';t work with it. Basically it says TypeError, cannot read properties of undefined, but i can't find out why as JS syntax is unfamiliar and the error only occurs when running , i can't debug becuase it works fine in the comeole and says eg u[level].cost is 100, but the same thing is undefined when actually runnign the ode, i'm sure it's all simple and trivial but i was so short of time that thew only way i could complete the agginem,tne in time was by fixing bugs by triual and erorr ,o so wtahever lan bguage fgeature iu neede to revise to solve it there's no time now. i think it;d be MOSTLY functional with this bug fixedd.

I still have lots of reading and notes to catch up on on CSS (Week 1) and accessibility (Week 2) and I can only do "half a job" on those right now. So since they aren't part of the focus for this week's work, I decided to skip them so there's minimal styling on this assignment and it isn't accessible. I'll make up for it in future weeks!

Their example used the visiblitychange event, but we don't have anything to actually change, we just need to stop the cookies baking, so all I had to do was check the document.hidden property whenever the timer callback runs.
